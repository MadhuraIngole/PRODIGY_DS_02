# PRODIGY_DS_02
# Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This repository contains scripts for cleaning and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset.


## Expected Format
The code assumes the data is in a common format like CSV

## Project Goals
- Clean and prepare the data for further analysis.
- Identify missing values and outliers.
- Explore the relationships between variables.
- Discover patterns and trends in the data.
- Generate visualizations to understand the data distribution.

## Code Structure
- data_cleaning.py: This script handles data cleaning tasks like handling missing values, identifying and handling outliers, and data type conversions.
- eda.py: This script performs exploratory data analysis on the cleaned data. It may include calculations of summary statistics, creating visualizations like histograms, scatter plots, and boxplots, and correlation analysis.
- notebooks: This folder contains Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration and visualization of the data (requires Jupyter installation).
  
Note: Script names and functionalities may vary depending on the specific project.

## Dependencies
The scripts likely rely on Python libraries for data manipulation and analysis. These will be specified within the scripts themselves. Common libraries may include:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
  
## Installation
You can install these libraries using the pip command in your terminal (e.g., pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn).

## Usage
- Obtain your data: Replace the example code with your own dataset located elsewhere on your system. Ensure the data path is correctly specified in the scripts.
- Run the scripts: Execute the Python scripts (data_cleaning.py and eda.py) in your terminal or a suitable Python environment.
- Explore the results: The scripts may generate output files or visualizations that you can explore to understand the cleaned data and identified patterns.
- Jupyter notebooks (optional): If present, open the notebooks in a Jupyter environment for interactive exploration and visualization.
